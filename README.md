# The Pizza serving website project
This repo is made for learning the concepts of PHP and training while making a pizza website that inserts data, process them and then outputs them into another tab with the ability to customize and delete them. It is also a training about how to prevent users from tampering into data and prevent them from using different methods like SQL injection to modify the data and get something that doesn't exist.
